# Workday-Planner_Scheduler

When opened the app will display an 11hr block.

The block will start from what some may consider a normal workday 7-5.
            --(I do not like these workdays)--

When data isn enetered in the text box the user will then save that data.

Once saved, the data gets saved into Local Storage on the system.

If and when appp is refreshed, the data in the text box will mno longer be there. But the data will still be saved into teh Local Storage file on the system. 



Project Notes....

I did have some issues getting the color-coding and time set up. 
I will be back at a later date to finalize some un-finished work.
